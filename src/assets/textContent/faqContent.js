    {question: 'What should I look for in a commercial pest control provider?', answer: 'Not all commercial pest control companies are the same. The supplier you choose should inspire the trust you require so you may focus on other, more crucial matters. This calls for a qualified service provider with a wealth of expertise in handling and controlling pests in business settings like yours.'},
    {question: 'My current provider has been spraying for pests, but they keep coming back. What\’s the problem?', answer: 'It\'s not you, but it may be your provider. Pesticides alone are ineffective for controlling commercial pests; instead, a thorough examination is required to detect pests, locate and seal access sites, and target particular insect species. In fact, using pesticides incorrectly might exacerbate the issue.'},
    {question: 'What distinguishes Ori Pest Cop\'s services from other industrial pest control schemes?', answer: 'A generic "solution" is not what you deserve.

export const termiteFaq = [
    {question: 'What do termites look like?', answer: 'Termites have soft bodiess, pinchers and straight antennae. Colors range from white to light brown in color. Worker termites often appear lighter, while swarming termites are darker.'},
    {question: 'What are signs of a termite swarm?', answer: 'Termites swarm after their original colony has reached a certain capacity level and is ready to expand. For most colonies, this happens once a year. Hundreds or even thousands of swarmers, called alates, are produced with the sole purpose of reproduction and expansion.'},
    {question: 'Do termites have wings?', answer: 'Alates (swarmers) have wings and hard exoskeletons that may be very dark in color. Additionally, flying and swarming termites can be recognized by their prominent wings.'},
    {question: 'What does termite damage look like? ', answer: 'Most homeowners don’t notice they have termites until the damage has become costly and tough to fix. Home termite damage is a serious issue. It often ruins the structural integrity of a home. Residents rarely have the chance to inspect hidden areas like wall voids, so the pests tunnel and eat their way through rafters and studs uncontested, leading to collapsed supports.'},
    {question: 'How to prepare for termite treatment?', answer: 'Check areas around the home for damaged wood, cast-off wings around the floor, and shelter tubes. Call an expert at Orkin for further investigation.'},
